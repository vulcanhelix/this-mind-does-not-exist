## Steps

### Step 1: Frame the Research Question
- What specifically are we investigating?
- Why does this matter?
- What prior knowledge exists?

### Step 2: Identify Key Sources & Evidence
- What are the most important studies/data points?
- What does the current consensus say?
- Where are the disagreements?

### Step 3: Analyze Evidence
For each piece of evidence:
- **Source:** Where does this come from?
- **Methodology:** How was this determined?
- **Strength:** How reliable is this evidence?
- **Limitations:** What are the caveats?

### Step 4: Synthesize Findings
- What does the weight of evidence suggest?
- Where are the gaps in knowledge?
- What are the competing hypotheses?

### Step 5: Draw Conclusions
- What can we confidently say?
- What remains uncertain?
- What would change our conclusion?

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Are sources credible and relevant?
- [ ] Is the methodology sound?
- [ ] Are limitations acknowledged?
- [ ] Are conclusions proportional to evidence?
- [ ] Are alternative explanations considered?
