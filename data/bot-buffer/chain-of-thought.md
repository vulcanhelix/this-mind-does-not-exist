## When to Use
- Mathematical calculations with multiple steps
- Logical deduction chains
- Any problem with a linear path from question to answer
- When you need to show your work clearly
- Word problems, algebra, calculus, physics problems

## Steps

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- Restate the problem in your own words
- Identify what is given (knowns)
- Identify what is asked (unknowns)
- Identify any constraints

### Step 2: Plan Your Approach
- What method or technique will you use?
- What tools, formulas, or principles apply?
- In what order should you proceed?

### Step 3: Execute Step-by-Step
For each step:
- **What:** State what you're doing
- **Why:** Explain why this step is needed
- **How:** Show the work
- **Result:** State the intermediate result

### Step 4: Verify
- Check: Does the answer make sense?
- Check: Do the units work out?
- Check: Can you verify with a different method?
- Check: Do edge cases hold?

### Step 5: Conclude
- State the final answer clearly
- Summarize the key reasoning chain

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Is each step justified?
- [ ] Do all steps connect logically?
- [ ] Is the final answer clearly stated?
- [ ] Have you verified the result?
